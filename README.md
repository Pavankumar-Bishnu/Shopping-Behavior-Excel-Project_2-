**Gender and Product Mix** :
- Males dominate the dataset (about 2,652 vs 1,248 females), so behavior is skewed towards male shoppers.
- Clothing is the most common category (1,737 records), followed by accessories (1,240), then footwear and outerwear, suggesting a focus on apparel and add‑ons.
  
**Spending And Revenue Potential** :
- Average purchase amount is around 60 USD with a spread from 20 to 100 USD, showing mid‑ticket transactions.
- The upper quartile spends 81 USD or more, indicating a sizable higher‑value segment that can be targeted for premium offerings.

- Purchases are relatively evenly distributed across seasons, with a small tilt towards Spring and Fall (around 999 and 975 records), indicating no extreme season concentration.

## 📊Sales Key Insights

 **Revenue Drivers**            :
- Clothing is the main revenue driver (about 104k USD), followed by accessories (about 74k), then footwear and outerwear.
- Senior_Citizens and Middle_Aged segments contribute similar, high revenue (about 88k and 87k USD), far above Youngsters and Teenagers.
  
 **Seasonal Performance**       :
- Fall is the best‑performing season (around 60k USD), with Spring and Winter very close behind, and Summer slightly lower but still strong.
- This fairly balanced pattern suggests year‑round demand with a mild lift in Fall for sales planning.
  
 **Product And Item Insights** :
- Top revenue‑generating items are Blouse, Shirt, Dress, Pants, and Jewelry, each around 10k USD, so they should be highlighted as key hero products on the dashboard.
- Footwear has the highest average review rating, while clothing has the lowest (though differences are small), indicating quality perception is strongest for footwear.
  
 **Shipping and monetization** : 
- 2‑Day Shipping, Express, and Free Shipping have slightly higher average order values than Standard and Next Day Air, so faster or free options may correlate with higher spend.
- Non‑subscribed customers generate about 170k USD vs roughly 63k USD from subscribed customers, so there is big revenue from non‑members and clear upside in converting them to subscriptions.
